### Explanation

1. **Server**: A machine that hosts the entire web infrastructure.
2. **Web Server (Nginx)**: Handles incoming HTTP requests and serves static content.
3. **Application Server**: Runs the application logic and processes dynamic requests.
4. **Application Files**: The codebase of the application, residing on the server.
5. **Database (MySQL)**: Stores the application's data.
6. **Domain Name (foobar.com)**: Points to the server IP `8.8.8.8`.
7. **DNS Record (www)**: A record that maps `www.foobar.com` to `8.8.8.8`.

### Communication Flow

- The user requests `www.foobar.com`.
- DNS resolves this to `8.8.8.8`.
- The server receives the request.
- Nginx (web server) processes the request.
- The application server handles dynamic content.
- The database (MySQL) provides data.
- The response is sent back to the user.

### Issues with This Infrastructure

1. **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)**: If the server fails, the entire site goes down.
2. **Downtime for Maintenance**: Restarting the web server for updates causes downtime.
3. **Scalability**: The single server cannot handle high traffic loads efficiently.
